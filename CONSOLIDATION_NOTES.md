# Project Structure Cleanup

This commit consolidates the duplicate folder structure that was causing confusion and bloat.

## Before:
- Cashapp/cashapp-currency-coach/ (duplicate)
- RoxyBoxy/ (duplicate)

## After:
- RoxyBoxy/ (single source of truth)

All files have been consolidated into the RoxyBoxy folder to match the GitHub repository name and eliminate redundancy.
